          <h2>Software Test Engineering Intern - STERIS</h2>
          <h3>May - August 2022</h3>
          <p>
            This past summer, I worked as a Software Test Engineering Intern for STERIS's Infection Prevention and
            Technology business unit. At STERIS, I worked on 3 main projects. My first project was a Jama connector that
            reduced the time it takes to run verification tests for the test engineers. This project used an in-house
            python automation framework to run tests that were collected using the Jama test automation API. The results
            were then updated and attached to test runs in Jama. For my second project, I designed a cycle control board
            (CCB) simulator that communicates with a human-machine interface formedical sterilizers. The simulator
            controls multiple CCB components, including 160 analog and digital IOs, a ferroelectric RAM chip for
            configuration storage, and application modules used to control physical product
            behaviors. Lastly, I refactored a GUI for a hardware tester that checked the functionality of circuit boards
            used for STERIS
            products.

          <h2>CS 3110 Teaching Assistant - Cornell University</h2>
          <h3>January 2022 - Present</h3>
          <p>
            I am a teaching assistant for Cornell's functional programming and data structures class. As an
            undergraduate teaching assistant, I hold office hours every week. During office hours, I help students with
            programming assignments and going over content. I also run a discussion section each week where I help
            20+ students complete lab questions. I am also responsible for grading exams and assignments. I decided to
            become a TA because I like help others and I really enjoyed the class when I took it.

          <p> As a Webmaster for the Society of Women Engineers, I am working on building their new website. We deplayed
            the new website after a semester of work at the end of spring 2022. I worked on combining all the pages.

          <h2>Software Engineering Intern - Square Fare</h2>
          <h3>December 2021 - January 2022</h3>
          <p> I worked as a software engineering intern for 3 weeks at Square Fare. Square Fare is a start-up company
            that
            has a subscription-based program that gives its users dish recommendations based on their health profile and
            goals. While I was there, I worked on expanding their database of restaurant dishes. I used REST APIs to
            pull
            restaurant data. I then worked a lot on analyzing the data and transforming it so it could be used in their
            database.
